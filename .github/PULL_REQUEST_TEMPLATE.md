<!-- If this PR is not ready for review yet, please mark it as Draft. -->

## Plugin

<!-- The canonical id. The part after the "/" is the plugin's directory in this repo. -->

- **Id:** `<author>/<plugin>`
- [ ] New plugin
- [ ] Update to an existing plugin (version bumped in `plugin.toml`)

## What it does

<!-- A short description, and what a user gets out of it. -->

## External dependencies

<!-- Any command or service the plugin shells out to, and why. List them in `dependencies` in plugin.toml too.
     Write "None" if it is self-contained. -->

## Testing

<!-- How you exercised it: entries opened, IPC messages sent, settings toggled. -->

- [ ] Tested on Niri
- [ ] Tested on Hyprland
- [ ] Tested on Sway
- [ ] Tested on another compositor:
- **Noctalia version tested against:** <!-- must be >= min_noctalia in plugin.toml -->

## Screenshots / Videos

<!-- Show the plugin running. Required for anything with a visual surface. -->

## Checklist

- [ ] The directory name matches the part of `id` after the `/` in `plugin.toml` exactly.
- [ ] It ships `plugin.toml`, `README.md`, `thumbnail.webp`, and `translations/en.json`.
- [ ] `README.md` follows the
      [README template](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/community-plugins/blob/main/README_TEMPLATE.md), documents
      every entry id and dependency, and includes exact panel IPC commands and launcher prefixes where applicable.
- [ ] I created `thumbnail.webp` with the [thumbnail generator](https://assets.noctalia.dev/plugins/thumbnail-generator.html).
- [ ] `version` follows semver and is bumped in this PR; `min_noctalia` is the version I tested against.
- [ ] Every non-English translation in this PR uses a locale supported by Noctalia core, and I can read, write, and
      understand that language well enough to review and maintain it (no unreviewed machine/LLM translations).
- [ ] I did not edit `catalog.toml`; CI generates it.
- [ ] This PR touches exactly one plugin directory.

## Code review attestation

Plugins run as trusted, unsandboxed Luau in the user's session. Confirm:

- [ ] The code is readable and not obfuscated, minified, or generated.
- [ ] It does not download and execute remote code.
- [ ] Every network call, filesystem write, and spawned process is something the description above accounts for.
- [ ] I have the right to publish this code under the `license` declared in `plugin.toml`.
