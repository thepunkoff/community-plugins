# Game Launcher

Browse and launch games from Steam, Lutris, and Heroic Games Launcher directly from your bar. Opens a floating panel with search, cover art, and one-click launch.

## Plugin

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ID | `alexander/game-launcher` |
| Entries | Bar widget: `launcher`; panel: `browser`; launcher provider: `search` |
| Launcher Prefix | `/g` |

## Requirements

Requires `libsqlite3-dev`, `xdg-utils` (provides `xdg-open`), and `gcc` on PATH.

```sh
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install libsqlite3-dev xdg-utils gcc

# Fedora
sudo dnf install sqlite-devel xdg-utils gcc

# Arch
sudo pacman -S sqlite xdg-utils gcc
```

The scanner binary (`gamelauncher`) is compiled automatically on first use — the plugin runs `cc` to build it when needed. No manual build step required.

## Usage

Add the bar widget `alexander/game-launcher:launcher` to your bar. The widget shows a gamepad icon — click it to open the browser panel.

In the panel, use the search bar to filter by name or runner. Click **Launch** on any game to start it.

To open the panel via IPC:

```sh
noctalia msg panel-toggle alexander/game-launcher:browser
```

From the launcher, type `/g` followed by a game name to search. Activate a result to launch the game.

## Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `glyph` | `glyph` | `device-gamepad-2` | Bar widget icon |
| `steampoacher_enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Enable steampoacher proxy for Steam cover art |

## Security & Data Flow

The plugin addresses all findings from Noctalia's security audit:

**1. No shell commands in C scanner** — The scanner (`gamelauncher.c`) uses only local filesystem reads and SQLite queries. No `system()`, `popen()`, `curl`, `wget`, `python3`, or `grep` is invoked. All network requests (cover downloads) are handled in Luau via Noctalia's built-in `noctalia.http` and `noctalia.download` APIs, which respect offline mode.

**2. No shell injection in launch paths** — The C scanner outputs protocol URLs only (e.g., `steam://rungameid/730`, `lutris:rungame/slug`, `heroic://launch/appid`). Luau validates each URL against known protocol prefixes, filters every character through a strict allowlist (`[%w_%-%.%/]` — no shell metacharacters), and double-quotes the argument before passing it to `xdg-open` via `noctalia.runAsync`.

**3. xdg-utils declared** — `xdg-utils` is listed in `plugin.toml` dependencies.

**4. Steampoacher opt-in & disclosure** — By default, Steam cover art is fetched directly from `store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails`. The API only provides small `header_image` art (460×215). For high-resolution library capsule covers, enable the **steampoacher** Cloudflare Worker by setting `steampoacher_enabled` to `true` in `~/.config/noctalia/plugins/game-launcher.json`. When enabled, Steam app IDs from your installed library are sent to the proxy at `steam-asset-proxy.steampoacher.workers.dev`, which returns a CDN capsule URL on `shared.steamstatic.com` with full-size 1200×450 art. Cover art for Heroic games uses the art URL from Heroic launcher metadata.

> [!NOTE]
> Without steampoacher enabled, Steam covers will be bad (600×900 instead of high resolution).

## Notes

- Scans all detected Steam library folders, Lutris SQLite databases, and Heroic store caches (Legendary, GOG, Nile).
- Results are cached in `~/.cache/gamelauncher/games.json` and rescanned on click if sources changed.
- No external CLI tools (curl, wget, python3, grep) are invoked anywhere in the plugin.
